Determine if the service involves discharge management. Evaluate both 'service_description' and 'diagnosis' fields based on the type of service provided:

1. If the service type is 'consultation' or 'consult', discharge management is not included. Therefore, in such cases, return False as discharge management is explicitly excluded.
   Example: Service type is 'consultation' â€” discharge management is not included.

2. For all other service types, check both 'service_description' and 'diagnosis' for any mentions of 'discharge' or 'discharge management'.
   - If 'discharge' or 'discharge management' is explicitly mentioned in either field, consider that discharge management is included.
   - If there is no mention of 'discharge' or 'discharge management', but the context leaves uncertainty (e.g., ambiguous terms related to patient transition or end of care without clear indication), return True indicating that the presence of discharge management remains unclear.

3. If neither 'discharge' nor 'discharge management' is mentioned and the context does not suggest uncertainty, return False indicating that discharge management is not involved.

The goal is to ensure a clear determination based on the information provided in the 'service_description' and 'diagnosis'. Use this structured approach to analyze and classify each service entry accordingly.

1. Review both 'diagnosis' and 'service_description' fields for keywords that indicate the nature of the service.
   - If 'follow-up' is mentioned without 'initial evaluation' in either field, classify the service as not having an initial evaluation.
     Example: 'Consultation follow-up' found in 'diagnosis' with no mention of 'initial evaluation' in either field.

2. If 'initial evaluation' is explicitly mentioned in either 'diagnosis' or 'service_description', classify the service as having an initial evaluation.
   Example: 'Initial evaluation with discharge' mentioned in 'diagnosis'.

3. If any service is described as 'X service only' (e.g., 'discharge only', 'consultation only') and there is no reference to 'initial evaluation' or other services in either field, classify the service as not having an initial evaluation.
   Example: 'Discharge only' mentioned in 'diagnosis' with no other services indicated in either field.
